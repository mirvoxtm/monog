Binah is the next-generation, **Markdown-inspired markup language** focused on simplicity and power for academic and general uses. It is the follow-up to the **Markers Markup Language**, aiming to be the **easiest and most accessible academic paper formatting language** available.

Binah is built <strong>entirely in Haskell</strong>, for robust performance and ease of use.

## 🚀 Key Features and Advantages

Binah is engineered for a **hassle-free** writing and formatting experience, providing the tools needed for professional-grade academic output without the complexity of traditional typesetting systems.

* **Markdown-Inspired Syntax:** Forget complex opening and closing tags. Binah adopts a simple, intuitive syntax, making it incredibly **easy to learn** and fast to write.
* **Automatic Document Structure:** Features like **automatic chapter numbering** and **summary/table of contents generation** are built-in, handling tedious formatting tasks automatically.
* **Monographic Infrastructure:** Designed specifically to handle the structure of **monographs**, **theses**, and **research papers**.
* **Built in Haskell:** The entire Binah compiler is implemented in **Haskell**, ensuring **high performance**, **reliability**, and robust **type-safety**.
* **Custom Styling Language (TISS):** Binah will feature its own custom stylesheet language (TISS), allowing for granular control over the document's appearance, either in a separate file or inline.
* **Complete Text Formatting:** Full support for **bold** (`*text*`), *italics* (`_text_`), ~~strikethrough~~ (`~text~`), and <u>underline</u> (`__text__`), along with monospaced text and **colored text** using Hexadecimal or RGB syntax.

## 📜 Creating a Binah Document

A `.binah` document is structured for clarity and ease of use, separating essential document components: **Title**, **Metadata**, and **Content**.

### Document Structure
A Binah document always begins with the title, followed by optional metadata, and then the content.

1.  **Title:** The very first line of the document.
2.  **Metadata:** Essential academic information defined by simple keywords.
3.  **Content:** The main body of the paper, composed of text, chapters, lists, etc.

### Metadata Keywords
Metadata is defined using simple keywords:

* `By:` (Author Names)
* `At:` (Institution/Affiliation)
* `Mentor:` (Advisor/Mentor's Name)
* `Location:` (City or General Location)
* `Date:` (Publication Date)
* `Keywords:` (SEO-friendly terms, separated by commas)

### Example Document

```binah
A Binah Document Title
By: Person A, Person B
At: University of Open Source
Location: Brazil
Keywords: Binah, Markup Language, Academic Paper, Haskell

This is the main body text, which is *not encapsulated* in any structural tag.

# This is a Chapter (Level 1 Heading)
Chapters act as sections and automatically populate the table of contents.

# This is the Next Chapter.
In the future, more tags shall be available.
## Nested Chapters (Level 2 Subheading)
Chapters are automatically closed when a new one is encountered.
```

<br>

## 🎨 Text Formatting

Binah utilizes familiar Markdown-like syntax for inline text styling:

| Syntax | Output | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `*This is bold*` | **This is bold** | Bold text |
| `_This is italic_` | *This is italic* | Italicized text |
| `~This is strikethrough~` | <s>This is strikethrough</s> | Strikethrough text |
| `__This is underlined__` | <u>This is underlined</u> | Underlined text |
| `` `Monospaced` `` | `Monospaced` | Code/Monospaced font |
| `{#FF0000}(Red Text)` | (The text in red) | Colored text (Hex) |
| `{0,0,255}(Blue Text)` | (The text in blue) | Colored text (RGB) |

## 🧭 Roadmap

Binah is in active development. Our goal is to offer a comprehensive feature set essential for academic publishing and research:

* [x] Text Formatting
* [x] Chapters and Arrow-Lists
* [x] Document Metadata
* [x] HTML Export
* [x] Automatic Chapter and Summary/ToC Generation
* [x] Bullet Lists, Arrow Lists
* [ ] Link, Image, Video and Audio Support
* [ ] References, Quotes, and Footnote Support
* [ ] Page and Printing Support
* [ ] PDF Export
* [ ] Exportação para Norma ABNT (**ABNT Norm Export** - Crucial for Brazilian academia)
* [ ] Custom Stylesheets with TISS
* [ ] Euler (Binah's Simple Math Language) Implementation

## ❓ Markers Users

If you are coming from the previous **Markers Markup Language**, the new syntax is a major shift towards simplicity. However, we plan to support legacy Markers tags in the future via a special **directive** to ensure a smooth transition for existing users.
