Binah Documentation

___

This is the official and always up-to-date documentation of *Binah*. Binah is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It also features its own Parser with support for interpretation to various other markup languages and academic formats. It was created by Miguel Aguiar in 2024 and finally came to fruition in 2025 as 'Markers - The Easy Markup Language'. After several revisions, *The Binah Language* came into fruition.

Binah can be used to write:
- Technical documentations
- Academic papers
- Blog posts
- Forum posts
- Other types of content that require rich formatting
- Any other structured text documents

The language is designed to be easy to read and write, and its syntax is simple and straightforward. It has support for customization of documents, parsing to other markup languages and formats - also featuring a easy tag system to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Binah is particularly well-suited for writing technical documentation, academic papers, and other types of structured text.

The aim is to create an easy markup language that is both powerful and flexible, while also being easy to learn and use. Binah is still in active development, and new features and improvements are being added regularly. The language is free to use and is released under the MIT License, so you can use it for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial.
